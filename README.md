# Solar-System-Relativity

A simulation of the solar system using principles of relativity.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- The following Python libraries:
  - `pygame`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
- A compatible development environment (e.g., [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/))

Install the necessary Python dependencies with pip:

```sh
pip install pygame numpy matplotlib
```
## Application
To run the solar system simulation, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Chilliou/Solar-System-Relativity.git
cd Solar-System-Relativity
```
2.  Run the main application file:
```sh
python ui.py
```
This will open a simulation window where you can observe the planetary movements according to relativity principles.

## Possible Improvements
Here are some ideas for improving this application:

- Add trajectory visualization so that you can see a possible trajectory when you open the po up.
- Add objects such as satelites
- Performance Optimization: Optimize the code to handle a larger number of celestial bodies.
- Zoom in to make visible planets such as Neptune and Uranus, which are not visible in the simulation because they are too far away.
